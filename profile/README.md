## Hi! 👋


🙋‍♀️ This is the GitHub organization of the [SOM Research Lab](https://som-research.uoc.edu/), a research team of the [Internet Interdisciplinary Institute (IN3)](https://www.uoc.edu/portal/es/in3/index.html), at the [Open University of Catalonia (UOC)](https://www.uoc.edu)

🌈 We welcome contributions to any repository, but because we have repositories with their own nature, please review their individual contribution guidelines.

👩‍💻 To know the maintenance status of our tools please check [this list](https://som-research.uoc.edu/research-tools/)

🍿 Fun fact: SOM is the Catalan word to say "We are"
