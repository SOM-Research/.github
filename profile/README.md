## Hi! 👋


🙋‍♀️ This is the GitHub organization of the [SOM Research Lab](https://som-research.uoc.edu/), a research team of the [Internet Interdisciplinary Institute (IN3)](https://www.uoc.edu/portal/es/in3/index.html), at the [Open University of Catalonia (UOC)](https://www.uoc.edu)

🌈 We welcome contributions to any repository, but as we have repositories with their very own nature, please review their individual contribution guidelines. Apart from the typical `README.md` file, we have tried to add `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `GOVERNANCE.md`, and `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` files whenever possible.

👩‍💻 To know the maintenance status of our tools please check [this list](https://som-research.uoc.edu/research-tools/)

🍿 Fun fact: SOM is the Catalan word to say "We are"

<!--

**Here are some ideas to get you started:**

🙋‍♀️ A short introduction - what is your organization all about?
🌈 Contribution guidelines - how can the community get involved?
👩‍💻 Useful resources - where can the community find your docs? Is there anything else the community should know?
🍿 Fun facts - what does your team eat for breakfast?
🧙 Remember, you can do mighty things with the power of [Markdown](https://docs.github.com/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)
